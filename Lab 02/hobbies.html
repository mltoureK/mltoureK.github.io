<h3>1.) Stand-up Comedy</h3>
<p><strong>Reason:</strong> Stand-up Comedy is an art form that I love to watch and practice for fun. Comedy is great at taking topics that are generally seens as contreversial and placing them in a positive light. This is a creative outlet for me and allows me to tell stories that come about in my life while bringing others joy in my life.</p>

<h3>2.) Excercise</h3>
<p><strong>Reason:</strong>Almost Nothing gives me the sense of progression like exercise. Exercise allows me to become stronger and has definite proof as well. I like how I can track myself according to the numbers of the dumbells I'm lifting. As well as the Health benefits.</p>

<h3>3.) Reading</h3>
<p><strong>Reason:</strong>Reading is calming. It teaches me how to organize my thoughts in an articulate style. Almost everything I've ever learned has been read. Reading is the most underrated gift that we aregiven, especially in a first world country. We aquire such a vast amount of knowledge that is easily accessible, because reading allows me to learn on my own</p>
